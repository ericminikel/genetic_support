T-I in Phase I-III with genetic support: 564/13490 historical vs. 285/6014 active. OR = 1.1, P = 0.08

Fisher's test for enrichment of genetically supported T-I pairs among those developed: OR= 10.7, P = 0.00e+00

Space of possible T-I pairs: 19338 genes times 767 indications with genetic insight = 14,832,246 T-I pairs

Number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 105860 = 0.71%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs: 16818

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 1169 = 1.10% of possible / 6.95% of Phase I+

After removing heavy hitters and restricting to most similar indications, the number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 33557 = 0.23%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 710 = 2.12%

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 68% (766/1133) have been developed only for unsupported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 6% (64/1133) have been developed only for supported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 27% (303/1133) have been developed for both.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 12139 unsupported indications and 710 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 17.1

Of launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 7394 unsupported indications and 449 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 16.5

Of non-launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 4745 unsupported indications and 261 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 18.2

Fisher test for difference between these ratios: OR=1.1, P=0.22.
