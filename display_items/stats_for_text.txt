T-I in Phase I-III with genetic support: 556/13345 historical vs. 281/5961 active. OR = 1.1, P = 0.085

Fisher's test for enrichment of genetically supported T-I pairs among those developed: OR= 10.9, P = 0.00e+00

Space of possible T-I pairs: 19338 genes times 756 indications with genetic insight = 14,619,528 T-I pairs

Number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 99731 = 0.68%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs: 16818

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 1146 = 1.15% of possible / 6.81% of Phase I+

After removing heavy hitters and restricting to most similar indications, the number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 33320 = 0.23%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 710 = 2.13%

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 68% (765/1132) have been developed only for unsupported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 6% (64/1132) have been developed only for supported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 27% (303/1132) have been developed for both.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 12147 unsupported indications and 710 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 17.1

Of launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 7424 unsupported indications and 449 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 16.5

Of non-launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 4723 unsupported indications and 261 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 18.1

Fisher test for difference between these ratios: OR=1.1, P=0.27.
