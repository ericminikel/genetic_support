Fisher's test for enrichment of genetically supported T-I pairs among those developed: OR= 11.0, P = 0.00e+00

Space of possible T-I pairs: 19338 genes times 769 indications with genetic insight = 14,870,922 T-I pairs

Number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 101954 = 0.69%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs: 16808

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 1155 = 1.13% of possible / 6.87% of Phase I+

After removing heavy hitters and restricting to most similar indications, the number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 34190 = 0.23%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 719 = 2.10%

Of possible genetically supported T-I 17691/34190 (52%) are from OTG in 2018-2022. Note that a total of 57167 T-I pairs acquired OTG support in 2018-2022 but only 17691 of them are in the universe of 34190 possible T-I pairs after removing heavy hitters and restricting to most similar indication.

Of possible genetically supported T-I 23377/34190 (68%) are from OTG (including all years). 

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 67% (774/1147) have been developed only for unsupported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 6% (66/1147) have been developed only for supported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 27% (307/1147) have been developed for both.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 12291 unsupported indications and 719 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 17.1

Of launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 7510 unsupported indications and 454 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 16.5

Of non-launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 4781 unsupported indications and 265 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 18.0

Fisher test for difference between these ratios: OR=1.1, P=0.29.
