T-I in Phase I-III with genetic support: 421/8162 historical vs. 216/3397 active. OR = 1.2, P = 0.011

Fisher's test for enrichment of genetically supported T-I pairs among those developed: OR= 11.6, P = 0.00e+00

Space of possible T-I pairs: 19338 genes times 774 indications with genetic insight = 14,967,612 T-I pairs

Number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 103688 = 0.69%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs: 10023

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 734 = 0.71% of possible / 7.32% of Phase I+

After removing heavy hitters and restricting to most similar indications, the number of possible T-I pairs with genetic support: 32718 = 0.22%

Number of clinically developed T-I pairs with genetic support: 481 = 1.47%

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 70% (643/923) have been developed only for unsupported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 7% (64/923) have been developed only for supported indications.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, 23% (216/923) have been developed for both.

Of targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 6959 unsupported indications and 481 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 14.5

Of launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 3485 unsupported indications and 269 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 13.0

Of non-launched targets with both ≥1 supported indication and ≥1 Phase I+ indication, there were 3474 unsupported indications and 212 supported indications pursued, a ratio of 16.4

Fisher test for difference between these ratios: OR=1.3, P=0.01.
